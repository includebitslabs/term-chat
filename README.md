# Term Chat

A terminal based chat application based in Golang. This project was made to learn about golang but there are legit use cases upon which I will be building. You can use this app to talk to friends in a boring computer lecture or with collegues in your company. This is a baby project RN but there are many cool things I want to test upon this.
